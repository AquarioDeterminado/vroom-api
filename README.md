# MQTT Application with Clients

## To test the code you need to

	Run the docker-compose.yml
	Run the mqtt_sub.py && mqtt-pub.py on separate terminals
	Open MQTT Explorer and connect it to the broker (only needed the first time)
	Then you can test the responses on the mqtt-pub.py terminal that sends the info to be received on both the MQTT Explorer && mqtt_sub.py
